# 🔥 STOKED BUILDS

Welcome to **Stoked Builds** — a launchpad for systems, specs, and side quests designed to reshape how we build, consume, and collaborate on the modern web. This is the home of **The Semantic Publishing Protocol**, **The Punk Forge**, and a growing ecosystem of tools, apps, and shared services built to be modular, AI-aware, and future-resilient.

## 🧠 The Semantic Publishing Protocol

> *“We’ve taught AI to read the internet.  
But what if we taught the internet to speak clearly — to humans and AI?”*

The **Semantic Publishing Protocol (SPP)** is a new standard for publishing content in a way that is semantically structured, machine-understandable, and context-aware by default. It’s not about replacing humans with AI — it’s about enabling **humans to publish meaning** in a form that AI can remix, recombine, and reuse *without scraping or guessing*.

SPP reimagines publishing as modular, interoperable, and intent-driven — built to power the next generation of agentic systems, knowledge layers, and personalised interfaces.

📘 [Specification coming soon]  
🧪 Demos and reference implementations live under **The Punk Forge** (see below)

## 🛠 The Punk Forge

> *“DIY. Rebellious. Precise chaos.”*

**The Punk Forge** is where we build and break things in public. It’s a growing suite of **reference apps**, **semantic publishing demos**, and **open source tools** designed to show what's possible when you combine structured content with composable design and agent-friendly architecture.

Here, you’ll find:
- ✨ Live-coded demos built on the Semantic Publishing Protocol
- 🧩 Modular reference apps for real-world use cases
- 🔧 Tools and services that help power AI-assisted systems in a human-first way
