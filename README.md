# 🧨 Stoked Builds

Welcome to **Stoked Builds** — the digital forge behind the **Semantic Publishing Protocol (SPP)** and a family of open systems built to survive and thrive in the era of autonomous agents, AI browsers, and a machine-interpreted web.

We are designing the **next layer of the internet**: machine-native, semantically rich, self-generating, and built with integrity.

## 🌍 The Collapse Loop We Must Avoid

> “If AI agents start reading the web for us, who's left to actually *visit* it?”

As autonomous agents and AI-powered browsers begin to **scrape, summarise, and act on behalf of users**, we are facing a dangerous feedback loop:

1. **Fewer page views for human-facing websites**  
2. 👉 **Less ad revenue for content creators**  
3. 👉 **Less incentive to produce content**  
4. 👉 **Less training material for LLMs and agents**  
5. 👉 **Diminishing content quality for everyone — including the agents**  

This loop leads to the slow **starvation of the open web** — a collapse of the very ecosystem that AI depends on to grow.

We are here to break that loop.

## 🔧 The Semantic Publishing Protocol (SPP)

**SPP** is an open specification that allows content to be published in a form that is:

- ✅ **Human-readable**
- ✅ **Agent-readable**
- ✅ **Structured, attributed, and context-rich**
- ✅ **Backwards compatible with today’s web**
- ✅ **Forward-compatible with tomorrow’s AI**

It transforms articles, products, posts, projects, and even memes into **semantic artefacts** — machine-interpretable blocks of meaning that can be reused, reasoned with, and built upon.

This is not SEO.  
This is not metadata.  
This is a **semantic OS for the web**.

## 🏴 The Punk Forge

Welcome to **The Punk Forge** — a growing collection of reference apps, open boilerplates, and protocol-first implementations showing how the SPP can power real systems.

> ⚙️ Built with rebellion. Structured with purpose.

This is where we ship working code for:
- 📜 Structured publishing
- 🧠 Agentic reasoning
- ⚡ Autonomous pipelines
- 💡 Real-world implementation of the SPP

If you're looking to contribute or understand how it works in the wild, start here.

## 🧬 Related Projects (Public & Private)

Many of the projects powered by the Stoked Builds ecosystem are still in stealth or early access. But soon, you'll see live releases of:

- **Get Stoked** – The autonomous growth engine that powers attention, attribution, and viral propagation for creators and platforms.
- **One Dollar Vote** – A new civic micro-voting system where dollars power decisions, and creators earn from debate.
- **My ADHD System** – A modular self-management stack designed to help neurodivergent brains thrive through automation and smart feedback loops.
- **The Semantic Publishing Boilerplate** – A fullstack starter to build SPP-native apps fast.
- **The Mediator** – AI-assisted communication clarity for strained relationships, co-parenting, and difficult dialogue.

When each is ready, this repo will point to the relevant public documentation or source code.

## 🚀 Get Involved

We are at **version 0.2.0** of the spec and growing fast.  
Now is the time to help shape the future:

- ⭐ Star this repo
- 📣 Share the vision
- 🧠 Join the conversation
- 🛠️ Fork, build, break, repeat

Let’s teach the web to **speak for itself** — clearly, semantically, agentically.

## 🧪 Experiments. Protocols. Punk.

Stoked Builds is not a company. It’s not a brand.

It’s a **signal** — for builders, rebels, technologists, and writers who believe the web can still evolve **without being consumed**.

Let’s build that next layer — together.
