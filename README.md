# 🧠 Semantic Publishing Protocol (SPP)

The **Semantic Publishing Protocol (SPP)** is an open specification that allows content to be published in a way that is **fully understandable by both humans and autonomous agents**.

It defines a system for encoding meaning, context, structure, and provenance **into the web itself** — enabling a new era of *agentic content consumption*, *autonomous reasoning*, and *machine-native publishing*.

This repo contains the canonical specification, supporting files, and reference artefacts.

## 🚨 The Collapse Loop We Must Avoid

> The rise of AI agents could silently starve the open web.

We are entering an era where autonomous agents — LLM-powered browsers, scrapers, plugins, assistants — **consume** the web **without viewing it**.

This triggers a dangerous recursive loop:

1. **AI agents read content directly** (scrape/summarise, bypassing the UI)
2. 👉 **Websites lose page views**
3. 👉 **Ad revenue drops**
4. 👉 **Creators stop publishing**
5. 👉 **Less quality content is available**
6. 👉 **AI agents degrade due to poor training data**
7. 🔁 Loop continues, starving the ecosystem

This isn’t theoretical. It’s already starting.

The Semantic Publishing Protocol exists to **break this loop** and ensure a thriving, high-quality, machine-readable web future.

## ✅ What SPP Enables

The protocol allows any content to be published as a **semantic artefact** — an entity that includes:

- 🧱 **Structured meaning**: Not just metadata, but full context, intent, and relevance
- 📜 **Human-readable content**: Still renders like a regular post or page
- 🤖 **Agent-readable structure**: Machines can understand, reuse, and reason with it
- 🧬 **Provenance and authorship**: Attribution is baked into the artefact
- 🌐 **Cross-site interoperability**: Content becomes portable, linkable, composable

SPP isn’t just about search engines or SEO.  
It’s about **equipping autonomous agents** to interact with content in a **truthful, contextual, and reversible** way.

## 📐 What’s in This Repo

- `spec/core.md` – The core Semantic Publishing Specification
- `spec/artefact-format.md` – The structure of semantic artefacts
- `spec/agent-interface.md` – How agents should interpret and interact with artefacts
- `examples/` – Sample artefacts, markup, and publishing formats
- `docs/` – Supplementary guidance, principles, and design philosophy

---

## 🌱 Who This Is For

- 🧠 **Developers** building agent-native platforms, summarisation tools, or AI-powered UIs
- ✍️ **Writers and publishers** looking to future-proof their content
- 🤖 **LLM engineers and AI researchers** designing agentic systems
- 🧩 **Open web advocates** and decentralisation pioneers

SPP is designed to be **easy to adopt** and **powerful when composed**.  
It works with HTML, Markdown, Astro, JSON, RSS, APIs, and more.

## 🧪 Current Status

We are currently in:

**`v0.2.0 – Early Public Spec Release`**

- ✅ Core specification defined
- ✅ Artefact structure validated in test projects
- ✅ Reference implementations underway
- 🚧 Community discussion now open
- 🚧 Integration layers in progress (Astro, Markdown, JSON-LD, etc.)

---

## 🧭 Where We’re Going

Future plans include:

- 🌐 Cross-site semantic artefact linking
- 🔗 Verified attribution and content signatures
- 🗺️ Knowledge graph overlays built from artefact webs
- 💡 Live “agent-native” site generators and CMS plugins
- 📦 Support for protocol-native packaging and indexing

> If the web is going to be read by agents —  
> it’s time we **publish for them**, not just around them.
